## Conclusion
Based on the reflections and comments provided in the retrospective, it is clear that our team recognizes the importance of consistent and effective work habits in order to achieve their goals. There were positive reflections about the team's communication and collaboration, as well as suggestions to better document their research, make deadlines, and utilize score matrices for decision-making. Our team also identified areas for improvement, such as avoiding late-night work and copy-pasting information for the paper.

In addition to the retrospective conclusion, it was noted that Arne received less positive feedback than Jonas and Maxim. Regardless of the cause, it was agreed that Arne would need to work harder in Sprint 2 to improve his performance and receive more positive feedback. Arne expressed his understanding of this and his willingness to put in the necessary effort to improve. With a team committed to continuous improvement and supporting one another, it is likely that Arne will be able to make significant progress in the next sprint.

Overall, this retrospective serves as a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect on their progress, celebrate successes, and identify areas for improvement moving forward. By implementing the suggestions and addressing the areas of improvement, the team can continue to work together effectively and efficiently towards achieving their goals.
