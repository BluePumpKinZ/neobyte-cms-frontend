### Findings
#### Angular
* Interceptors are weird.
* I do not understand the structure of the styling files very well.
* When the DOM is created each component gets a custom number, therefor if you use follow up on classnames, they will not match anymore. This happend when I made some layout in one file and tried splitting it up into components.
* When a component is included inside an other one, while rendering the dom, an overarching tag is added.
#### .NET
* Applying distributed tracing in an ASP.NET Core project is a lot harder then advertised by the speaker on the TI Conference Days.
