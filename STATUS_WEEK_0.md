## Project Status
### Collaboration
The team goes along well and is aware of the workload and project scope. For that reason we've already started our research and project development a weak early.
### Findings
#### Hexagonal architecture
* Lot of forward methods
* Clean structure
* Easy to rewrite single part of code without influencing other parts
#### Minimal API
* Endpoint filters are a powerfull tool for custom behaviour (body validation, custom auth with principals)
### Technologies researched
* Angular
* Hexagonal architecture
* Minimal API
* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Distributed Tracing
